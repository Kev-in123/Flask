# Flask
An example of a Flask site

Edit the HTML files in templates and CSS files in static to change the look of your site

Run `app.py` or `app.bat` to start it, if logging is off, it won't display a link. By default the link is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

If you run `app.bat` you might need to edit it depending on your installation of python
